## First alternative

Step 1: Backup the Source CM4 eMMC

Connect the source CM4 and the target CM4 to a Linux system via USB.

Boot both CM4 devices using the USB mass-storage gadget. You can use the rpiboot tool for this.

Confirm that both systems are recognized by the Linux system using the lsblk command.

Use the dd command to create an image of the source CM4 eMMC and save it to the Linux system. Run the following command:

sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=cm4_source.img bs=1M status=progress

Step 2: Clone the Image to the Target CM4 eMMC
Insert a USB drive into the Linux system and copy the image (cm4_source.img) to the USB drive for transfer to the target CM4.

Insert the USB drive into the target CM4.

Boot the target CM4 using the USB mass-storage gadget.

Use the dd command to write the image to the target CM4 eMMC. Run the following command:

sudo dd if=cm4_source.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M status=progress

Alternative Method (Using rpi-clone):
Connect both CM4 devices to a Linux system via USB and boot them using the USB mass-storage gadget.

Confirm that both systems are recognized by the Linux system using the lsblk command.

Install the rpi-clone tool on the Linux system:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rpi-clone

Use rpi-clone to clone the source CM4 eMMC to the target CM4 eMMC. Run the following command:

sudo rpi-clone -s /dev/mmcblk0 -t /dev/mmcblk1

(Replace /dev/mmcblk0 and /dev/mmcblk1 with the appropriate device identifiers for your setup.)

#### Step 1: Enable SSH on the Source Raspberry Pi CM4

1. Boot up the source Raspberry Pi CM4.
2. Enable SSH on the source CM4 by creating an empty file named `ssh` in the `/boot` directory. You can do this by running:

    touch /boot/ssh

3. Reboot the source CM4 to enable SSH:
    sudo reboot

#### Step 2: Connect to the Source Raspberry Pi CM4 via SSH

1. Find the IP address of the source CM4. This can be done using your router's interface or tools like `nmap`:
    nmap -p 22 192.168.1.0/24

    Replace `192.168.1.0` with your network's subnet.

2. Connect to the source CM4 via SSH:

    ssh pi@<source_IP_address>

    Default password: `raspberry`

#### Step 3: Create an Image of the Source CM4

1. Use `dd` to create an image of the source CM4's eMMC storage. Execute the following command on the source CM4 via SSH:

    sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M status=progress | gzip > /path/to/source_cm4_image.img.gz

    Replace `/path/to/source_cm4_image.img.gz` with the desired path on the source CM4 to store the image.

2. Once the process is complete, download the image to your local machine using `scp`:

    scp pi@<source_IP_address>:/path/to/source_cm4_image.img.gz /path/on/local/machine/

#### Step 4: Copy the Image to the Target Raspberry Pi CM4

1. Boot up the target Raspberry Pi CM4.

2. Enable SSH on the target CM4 using the same steps as in Step 1.

3. Reboot the target CM4:
    sudo reboot

4. Find the IP address of the target CM4.

5. Copy the image to the target CM4 using `scp`:
    scp /path/on/local/machine/source_cm4_image.img.gz pi@<target_IP_address>:/path/on/target_cm4/

#### Step 5: Write the Image to the Target CM4's eMMC Storage

1. Connect to the target CM4 via SSH:
    ssh pi@<target_IP_address>

2. Navigate to the directory where the image is located:
    cd /path/on/target_cm4/

3. Use `dd` to write the image to the target CM4's eMMC storage:

    gzip -dc source_cm4_image.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M status=progress

4. Once the process is complete, reboot the target CM4:

    sudo reboot
