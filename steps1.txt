Step 1: Backup the Source CM4 eMMC
Connect the source CM4 and the target CM4 to a Linux system via USB.

Boot both CM4 devices using the USB mass-storage gadget. You can use the rpiboot tool for this.

Confirm that both systems are recognized by the Linux system using the lsblk command.

Use the dd command to create an image of the source CM4 eMMC and save it to the Linux system. Run the following command:

sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=cm4_source.img bs=1M status=progress


Step 2: Clone the Image to the Target CM4 eMMC
Insert a USB drive into the Linux system and copy the image (cm4_source.img) to the USB drive for transfer to the target CM4.

Insert the USB drive into the target CM4.

Boot the target CM4 using the USB mass-storage gadget.

Use the dd command to write the image to the target CM4 eMMC. Run the following command:

sudo dd if=cm4_source.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M status=progress

Alternative Method (Using rpi-clone):
Connect both CM4 devices to a Linux system via USB and boot them using the USB mass-storage gadget.

Confirm that both systems are recognized by the Linux system using the lsblk command.

Install the rpi-clone tool on the Linux system:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rpi-clone

Use rpi-clone to clone the source CM4 eMMC to the target CM4 eMMC. Run the following command:

sudo rpi-clone -s /dev/mmcblk0 -t /dev/mmcblk1

(Replace /dev/mmcblk0 and /dev/mmcblk1 with the appropriate device identifiers for your setup.)
